SpotifyAPI is a robust PHP-based API designed to interact with Spotify's vast music library. With this API, you can search for songs, retrieve detailed track, album, and playlist information, and even download tracks. Host it on your own server, such as via Cpanel, and unlock a world of music possibilities! üí•

## Features üåü

- üîç Search for songs with custom queries
- üéµ Retrieve detailed track information
- üíø Fetch comprehensive album details
- üìã Access playlist data with track listings
- ‚¨áÔ∏è Download tracks directly from Spotify URLs

## Setup Instructions ‚öôÔ∏è

Follow these steps to host SpotifyAPI on your own server using Cpanel:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the project from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/TheSmartDevs/SpotifyAPI.git`

2. **Upload Files to Server:**
   - Use Cpanel's File Manager or an FTP client to upload `spotify.php` and `spotipy.php` to your server's public directory (e.g., `public_html`).

3. **Configure Spotify API Credentials:**
   - Open both `spotify.php` and `spotipy.php` in a text editor.
   - Replace `$client_id` and `$client_secret` with your own Spotify API credentials. Get these by creating an app at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).

4. **Set File Permissions:**
   - Ensure the PHP files have executable permissions (typically 755). In Cpanel, right-click the files, select "Change Permissions," and set accordingly.

5. **Test Your Deployment:**
   - Access the API via your domain, e.g.:
     - Search: `https://yourdomain.com/spotify.php?q=SEARCH_QUERY`
     - Track Download: `https://yourdomain.com/spotipy.php?url=SPOTIFY_TRACK_URL`

## Usage Examples ‚úÖ
